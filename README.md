# Techniques and modeling
* Cross-validation
    - Experiments on cross-validation ([Samuele Mazzanti](https://towardsdatascience.com/12-ways-to-test-your-forecasts-like-a-pro-a783016c2515), inspired by [Victor Cerqueira et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11744))
* Global and local modeling
    - [Principles and Algorithms for Forecasting Groups of Time Series: Locality and Globality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00444)
* Feature extraction and meta learning
    - `slide` Meta learning on how to forecast time series. [FFORMS: what type of models are most suitable for a given time serie](https://robjhyndman.com/papers/fforms.pdf)?
# Applications

## Retail forecasting
- `slide` [Retail sales forecasting at Walmart](https://forecasters.org/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/7-c6dd08fee7f0065037affb5b74fec20a/2017/08/Seaman_ISF-2017.pdf) (Seaman). Predict for what? Addresses replenishment and pricing issues

## Others
- `paper` [Empirically validated probabilistic forecasts of energy technology costs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S254243512200410X). How to estimate stuff in a regime of technological uncertainty (due to [learning effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects))?
